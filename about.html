            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                Pine Valley was once a peaceful town nestled in the heart of a lush forest. For generations, its inhabitants lived in harmony with nature, their homes protected by ancient pine trees that stood as silent guardians over the valley.
            </p>
            <p>
                But peace never lasts forever. When hostile forces emerged from beyond the valley's borders, threatening to destroy everything the people of Pine Valley held dear, a call went out for defenders. As the newly appointed commander, you must rally your troops and protect the town from wave after wave of increasingly dangerous enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fate of Pine Valley rests in your hands. Will you lead from the command center, or fight alongside your soldiers on the front lines? The choice is yours.

            <h2>Development Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Protect Pine Valley was born from a desire to merge two beloved gaming genres: real-time strategy and third-person action. We believe that players shouldn't have to choose between being a strategic mastermind or an action heroâ€”they should be able to be both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built in Unity and developed by a passionate indie team in Boston, our goal is to create an experience that respects both strategic thinking and player skill, offering a game that's as rewarding to plan as it is to play.
